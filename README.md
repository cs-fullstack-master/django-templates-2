# Classwork on Django Template Inheritance

Starting with the sample Django project covered in class, make the following additions:
- Add a new template that inherits from the existing ./base.html

- Create a new view that inserts *at least* one item in the context of the template and renders it

- Add the necessary route to activate your display
